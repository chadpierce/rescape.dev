      <description>Trying to Remember What I&amp;rsquo;ve Done After looking over the code where I left it a few months ago it&amp;rsquo;s not in a super horrible state. Much of what I&amp;rsquo;ve done to this point was getting a game mechanic to work and then quickly moving on to the next task. This left a lot of sloppy and hacked together code. In most other projects that is typically where I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it, but for this project I&amp;rsquo;d like to clean things up some.</description>

      <description>Nethack, but without the kitchen sink I began playing roguelikes in my late high school / early college years and started with Nethack. I never got very far. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been an on-again off-again player of the genre. The game I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the most time with is Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS). It&amp;rsquo;s also the only roguelike I&amp;rsquo;ve won. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling with vanilla Angband and have spent enough time with the original Rogue to learn I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at it.</description>
