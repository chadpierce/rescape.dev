      <description>Nethack, but without the kitchen sink I began playing roguelikes in my late high school / early college years and started with Nethack. I never got very far. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been an on-again off-again player of the genre. The game I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the most time with is Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS). It&amp;rsquo;s also the only roguelike I&amp;rsquo;ve won. Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling with vanilla Angband and have spent enough time with the original Rogue to learn I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at it.</description>
